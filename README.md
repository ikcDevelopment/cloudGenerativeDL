## What is Generative Modeling

Is a branch of machine learning that involves training a model to produce new data that is similar to a given 
dataset.

In order to build a generative model, we requiere a **dataset** consisting of many examples of the entity we are
trying to generate.  This is known as the **training data**, and one such data points is call an **observation**.
